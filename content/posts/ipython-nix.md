I often want to quickly experiment with a Python package without the
whole virtualenv shenanigans. For that I have an `ipython-nix` command
in my `.bashrc`:

<!--more-->

```bash
function ipython-nix {
    packages=""
    for arg in $@; do
        packages="$packages $arg"
    done

    nix-shell -p "with pythonPackages; [ ipython $packages ]" --command ipython
}
```


Using it requires knowledge of the nix-names for Python packages, but
those are generally very predictable. E.g.

```bash
$ ipython-nix scikitlearn
