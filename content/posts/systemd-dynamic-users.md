systemd 232 introduced a really cool feature that allows running as a dynamically allocated user with `DynamicUser=yes`.

Both group and user are set to a free ID in the range  61184...65519. E.g.:

```bash
$ sudo systemd-run -p DynamicUser=yes -r -t id
Running as unit: run-re94d829d72f74046a1f402348bef2487.service
